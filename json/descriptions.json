  "Benny wakes up in a dark room. He realizes that Fala and Nodo have locked him in the castle jail. Unfortunately, it seems like the great evil has possessed them and decided to lock him up for good. Luckily for him, the guards may have forgotten to lock the cell door behind them!\n\nThe room looks dilapidated, like nobody’s bothered to maintain it since there hasn’t been any prisoners for years. Cobwebs are scattered around the room, and it looks like the cell is bigger than he thought. There’s a table in the corner, with an old looking scroll that might be made from papyrus. Under the table, he can see a puzzle piece. It seems like the hidden puzzles he heard about when he was being transported into the cell were real. He might have a shot at escaping.\n",
  "Unfortunately for Benny, in the next room he can’t see anything obvious. He thinks he might have to come back later in case there’s something hidden in the room that he can’t see right now. It feels like there might be something hidden in this room.\n",
  "Benny realizes that this cell he’s in right now is really big. It still looks about the same as the other two rooms, lots of cobwebs and some various scattered furniture pieces. This room seems special, though. There’s a pedestal in the middle with a puzzle on it? Yep. Looks like a puzzle. Maybe this will help him escape?\n",
  "Benny finds himself in a hallway, that doesn’t quite seem to have an end to it. He thinks nothing of it, as it appears just to be a hallway.\n",
  "Still looks like a hallway.\n",
  "At last, Benny finds a turn in the corridor. Maybe he’ll find something hidden in the next room?\n",
  "Benny is still in a hallway, but it looks like he’s finally getting somewhere. He can see a room to his left. Maybe he should investigate it?\n"
